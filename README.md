# **QUIPY : AI-Driven Chatbot for Data Access and Insights**

QUIPY is an advanced AI-powered chatbot designed to streamline access to customer data stored in internal databases. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, QUIPY enables users to query databases using natural language and obtain contextually relevant, accurate responses. This solution is especially valuable for organizations dealing with vast amounts of data, providing an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for complex queries or technical expertise.

**Use Case Example:** Walmart generates over 2.5 petabytes of data per hour. QUIPY helps businesses like Walmart manage and utilize their data more effectively by providing instant, AI-driven insights directly from their internal databases.

## **Objective**

The primary goal of QUIPY is to simplify data access and interpretation for business users. With this AI-driven chatbot, users can:

- Seamlessly query internal databases using **natural language**, without needing specialized knowledge in SQL or data science.
- Extract meaningful insights from large datasets to support **strategic decision-making**.
- Visualize complex data through **intuitive charts and graphs**, facilitating better communication of insights.
- Detect **patterns, anomalies, and correlations** using AI-powered analysis, saving time and improving efficiency.
  
QUIPY empowers users to focus on high-value tasks by automating data querying and interpretation processes, ensuring easy access to key data for informed business decisions.

## **Solution**

QUIPY offers an intuitive interface that transforms how businesses interact with their data. It leverages **LLMs** for natural language processing (NLP), ensuring that even non-technical users can ask questions and get relevant insights from complex databases.

### **Key Features:**
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Query internal databases without needing technical knowledge of SQL or complex data structures.
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Automatically generate charts, graphs, and dashboards to easily communicate insights.
- **AI-Powered Analytics**: Identify hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies, aiding faster and more informed decision-making.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets and growing data volumes effortlessly without compromising on performance.

## **Methodology**

1. **Database Connectivity**  
   Establish a secure and reliable connection to internal databases, allowing for the extraction of detailed metadata, including schema, table structures, and data relationships.

2. **Contextual Data Enrichment**  
   Enrich the extracted metadata with business definitions, data quality indicators, and other context to enhance the usability of the data for the LLM.

3. **Natural Language Query Processing**  
   Users interact with QUIPY through a user-friendly interface. The LLM interprets natural language queries, refines them, and generates precise SQL or other database-specific queries for data retrieval.

4. **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
   Retrieved data is processed and cleaned to ensure high-quality results, allowing for accurate insights.

5. **Statistical Analysis & Visualization**  
   The cleaned data undergoes statistical analysis to identify patterns and generate insights. Visualization tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, or **Tableau** are used to create comprehensible visuals for effective insight communication.

6. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   An interactive dashboard is provided, enabling users to explore specific metrics, track data over time, and monitor key performance indicators.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**:  
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS
   - Responsive and user-friendly design for a seamless user experience.

- **Backend**:  
   - Django (Python-based framework)  
   - Robust backend for managing data requests, user authentication, and API integration.

- **AI and NLP**:  
   - **LLAMA (Large Language Model)** for natural language processing and query interpretation.
   - **Neo4j** for handling complex data relationships and graph-based data structures.

- **Data Visualization & Analysis**:  
   - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau for generating insightful visualizations.

## **How It Works**

1. **User Interaction**:  
   Users interact with QUIPY via a simple chat interface, asking natural language questions about their internal data.
   
2. **Natural Language Processing**:  
   QUIPY interprets the user's query, refines it using the LLM, and generates a database query (SQL or equivalent).

3. **Data Retrieval**:  
   The query retrieves the relevant data from the internal database, which is then processed for analysis.

4. **Insight Generation**:  
   The retrieved data is analyzed for patterns and insights, and relevant visualizations (charts, graphs) are automatically generated.

5. **Dashboard**:  
   Users can view their results in an interactive dashboard, allowing for further exploration and decision-making.

## **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fromjyce/Quipy.git quipy
   cd quipy
   ```

2. **Start the Application**  
   ```bash
   cd src

   python quipy.py
   ```

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Multi-Language Support**: Allow users to interact in multiple languages, expanding accessibility.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile version of QUIPY for on-the-go data access.
- **Advanced Data Security**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for secure data handling.
- **Integration with Cloud Databases**: Extend support to popular cloud-based databases like AWS RDS, Google BigQuery, and Azure SQL.
